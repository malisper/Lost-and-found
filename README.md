# Lost-and-found
A simulated agent which is able to figure out its location in a maze, even though it moves randomly and doesn't know which direction it moves in. It works by using Hidden Markov Chains to calculate the probability it is at each square. This is an implementation of the Vacuum bot from chapter 15 of Artificial Intelligence a Modern Approach.
